## Overview

This is my simple Task Manager app to show my skills on coding, problem solving, and learning new tools. Using Github Copilot in VS Code really helped me to apply new skills.
I wanted to make a small project with the skills I have, and learn new skills (python, flask, javascript) on the go.

Features
- add a task
- view all tasks
- mark a task as completed
- delete a task
- runs on localhost

## How to run the Task Manager

Running the App:
1. Navigate to the project directory.
    cd [add your directory path here]
2. Set up a virtual environment:
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Flask:
    pip install flask
4. Run the Flask app: 
    python app.py
5. Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 or http://localhost:5000 to see your task manager app in action.

## Process

### Built with
- http
- css
- python
- flask * new
- javascript * new
- github copilot * new
- vs code

### What I learned

I learned new skills (flask, javascript, github copilot) and troubleshooting, when the first code did not work as I hoped on my browser. I had to add the local host, aft6er it worked with it I found the problem with the port.
I learned how to combine css styhles with a bit of javascript, but I have to learn more javascript if I want to use it more.
Colors are not what I originally planned, but this is usable. I don√§t know what ios best, but I can recognise when it is not good to use.

## Continued development

To get the different items inside the list-items to be separate, I have to check more how to use javascript.
I want to check how to get this nicer to use on mobile too.
