## Overview

This is my simple Task Manager app to show my skills on coding, problem solving, and learning new tools. Using Github Copilot in VS Code really helped me to apply new skills.
I wanted to make a proper project with the skills I have, and learn new skills (javascript, flask) on the go.

Features
- add a task
- view all tasks
- mark a task as completed
- delete a task

## How to run the Task Manager

Running the App:
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Set up a virtual environment:
3. Install Flask:
4. Run the Flask app:
5. Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 or http://localhost:5000 to see your task manager app in action.
